            <p>Various kinds of work are carried out of Ireland in order to protect
                bird species.

            <h2>Research and monitoring</h2>
            <p>An essential part of bird conservation is monitoring and recording information
                abut the space such as their numbers, breeding habits, etc.
            </p>
            <p>Scientific Research may be carried out to determine whether a species is in
                decline and how to address the problem.

            <h2>Habitat protection</h2>
            <p>The destruction of habitat is a serious threat to many birds and therefore
                protecting habitats is crucial to protecting the species.
            </p>
            <p>One example of this is the preservation of wetlands in Ireland</p>

            <h2>Control invasive plants and animals</h2>
            <p>Mink and rats are a predator that threaten many bird species, for example by 
                eating their eggs.
            </p>
            <p>Rhododendron is and example of an invasive plant. If left unchecked it can take 
                over large areas, overrunning other native plants and disrupting the 
                biodiversity, which can lead to lower observe numbers of some bird species
                in those areas.
